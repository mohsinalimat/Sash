## Usage

You can show a tutorial for one gesture.

```objc
AYGestureHelpView *helpView = [AYGestureHelpView new];
[helpView doubleTapWithLabelText:NSLocalizedString(@"Double tap to open the menu", nil) labelPoint:CGPointMake(self.view.center.x, self.view.center.y + 70) touchPoint:self.view.center dismissHandler:nil hideOnDismiss:YES];
```

Or you can chain gestures.

```objc
AYGestureHelpView *helpView = [AYGestureHelpView new];
[helpView doubleTapWithLabelText:NSLocalizedString(@"Double tap to open the menu", nil) labelPoint:CGPointMake(self.view.center.x, self.view.center.y + 70) touchPoint:self.view.center dismissHandler:^{
  [helpView swipeWithLabelText:NSLocalizedString(@"Swipe to scroll through cards", nil) labelPoint:CGPointMake(self.view.center.x, self.view.center.y + 70) touchStartPoint:CGPointMake(self.view.center.x + 25, self.view.center.y) touchEndPoint:CGPointMake(self.view.center.x - 25, self.view.center.y) dismissHandler:^{
    [helpView swipeWithLabelText:NSLocalizedString(@"Pull down to refresh", nil) labelPoint:CGPointMake(self.view.center.x, self.view.center.y + 70) touchStartPoint:CGPointMake(self.view.center.x, self.view.center.y - 50)  touchEndPoint:self.view.center dismissHandler:nil hideOnDismiss:YES];
  } hideOnDismiss:NO];
