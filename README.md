# Sash - Reminders based on Prayers


بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم، الحمدلله رب العالمين والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله،

## Welcome

Hello friend, this is Hussein, the programmer and the designer of this project, Sash is a productivity app for creating todo's based on prayer times, so your day will be organized based on prayer times, I think you have downloaded the applicaiton and saw what I'm talking about, cool ha 🙈?

I made the project open source, so other people can take a look and participate in this project, hoping it will reach muslims around the world, who has the same passion as me ( maybe more? ).

The idea is taken based on something that Dr. Abdulrahman Thakir Alhashemi said in one of his lectures talking about making our prayers the centeral part of our day.

## How to dive in the project

One thing you may need to understand before you dive deep, is that there are some parts of the application that are not being used and won't be noticied, well, that's mainly because Sash was developed for different UI, and it has been changed to be more simple and minimalist, but we have kept the components used to make those happen.

Project is spilitted into components, each component mainly for one part of the application, you may begin with Base group, which contains the main stuff, I mean the AppDelegate and others, and dive into each group to see it's contents and how it's being managed.

Later on I may add more explaination for what I did, but believe me, it's not that bad for organization :)

## Want to Constribute?

I highly appreciate this, and that's why I made Sash open source, so please just submit a pull request, and we'll be friends :)

## What's Next?

I'll keep this in my mind 😻, may share this later inshallah ❤️


وآخر دعوانا أن الحمدلله رب العالمين
